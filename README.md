# Higher-order-functions

# What is Higher-order-functions?
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. They allow for the creation of more abstract and flexible code by combining simple functions to build more complex ones. This concept is common in functional programming and is a key aspect of writing maintainable and reusable code.
